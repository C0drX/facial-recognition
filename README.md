### 🚀 ***About This Project***
Have a **huge collection of images (1000 - 7000+ images)** of your **family, friends, or team members** and need to find every image containing a specific person?

This **Python-based facial recognition tool** helps you do exactly that! 🧑‍💻

- Just provide a **sample image** of the person
- Specify the **dataset folder**
- The program will scan all images, **compare faces**, and let you **list/move/copy/delete** the matched ones!

---

### ✨ ***Features***
- ✅ **Find a specific person** even in group photos
- ✅ **Adjustable tolerance** for better accuracy based on image quality
- ✅ **Copy/Move/Delete** matched images
- ✅ **View matched images in a separate window**
- ✅ **List the paths of matched images**
- ✅ **Smart threshold adjustment** for best results
